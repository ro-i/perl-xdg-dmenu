perl-xdg-dmenu
==============

Just a small perl script to use dmenu with xdg .desktop-files.
(cf. https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/)

You may adapt the menu to your needs in the config section at the beginning
of the script.

Project Status
--------------
I wrote this software some time ago in order to learn something new and 
in order to use it and to play with it. However, I am no longer satisfied
with the current state of the project. That's why it is now archived for the
time being. :)
